Master the essential tools for modern scientific computing. This intensive boot camp covers the foundational skills every researcher needs: navigating the command line, programming in Python and R, managing software environments with Conda, and deploying reproducible workflows with Singularity. Whether you're analyzing data, running simulations, or building pipelines, you'll gain the practical skills to work efficiently and effectively. The boot camp will be held Dec. 8th, 10th, and 12th from 8:30am to 5pm each day.
