## Staff and Students
Our team offers custom bioinformatics services to academic and private organizations. We have a strong academic background with a focus on cutting edge, open source software. We replicate standard analysis pipelines (best practices) when appropriate, and/or develop novel applications and pipelines when needed, however we always emphasize biological interpretation of the data.

## Workshop Goals

Participants will come away from this workshop with foundational knowledge of the basics of scientific computing in bash, R, and python. Our goal is to provide 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on work. Additional exercises to be completed outside of class time are provided. We hope participants will engage with these resources to further their understanding of the course materials.

## Structure of the Workshops

This workshop is offered in a remote format. We will be using multiple technologies in order to help facilitate a maximum amount of interaction.

#### Zoom

Course lecture, discussions, and one-on-one help/troubleshooting will be conducted using a zoom meeting.

  * Participants will be provided one-on-one troubleshooting by our staff, screen sharing and even remote control when needed.
  * The Chat features of Zoom will **not** be our primary mode of text communication as its history is not reliable.
  * We will stick to a schedule to allow people to plan their day and know when they need to be back at their computers for lecture.
  * Video recordings of lectures will be made available to participants.

Because video is involved, we ask everyone to be respectful and we reserve the right to remove someone if they are being disrespectful or disruptive.

####  Slack

Text based communication will be conducted via a Slack channel. Staff will be monitoring the Slack channel to answer questions (and schedule a Zoom break out room if needed). If you know the answer to someone else's question, feel free to answer it.

#### Patience

We ask for a little more patience as we have a wide background in workshop participants, but we are committed to providing you the best educational experience we can (under the current conditions).
