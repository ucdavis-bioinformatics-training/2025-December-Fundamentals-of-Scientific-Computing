# RStudio and R notebooks

While all of the code functions from the command line, we recommend using RStudio for these course materials.

**Launch RStudio.**

## RStudio

RStudio is a convenient integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a number of features that improve the experience of learning to the basics of R.

Your RStudio window should look something like this:

### The console

On the left hand side is the *console*. This is a command-line interface for R. Type a command, press enter to run it, and the result appears below.

![Running a simple command](rstudio-2.png)
For now, ignore the `[1]` at the beginning of the line. We will come back to it in a later section.

In R, the prompt is a `>` character. At the beginning of the line, it indicates that R is ready for your next command.

In these materials, code appears in gray boxes, like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

Whenever you see one of these boxes, run the code yourself.

What happens if you press enter before you meant to?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 + 
```

If you press enter before finishing a command, the next line will begin with a `+` character. This lets you know that R is expecting more input.

### The workspace browser

In the upper right panel is the *workspace (or environment) browser*. This window shows the objects present in the environment. Currently there are none.

Objects are data stored in memory. The following code adds an object to the workspace.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- 1 + 1
```

**Run the code in the gray box above.**

![Assigning output](rstudio-4.png)

Unlike the first time we ran `1 + 1`, nothing is printed to the console.

Instead, a new value appears in the workspace browser.

Why? The `<-` is a special pair of characters called the *assignment operator* that stores the result of the addition in the *object* referred to on the left-hand side of the "arrow." If no object with the name exists, one is created.

![Evaluating a variable](rstudio-6.png)

R evaluates the object and returns its value, 2. Objects retain their values until removed or reassigned.

The `<-` character pair is one of two assignment operators in R. In most situations, it is equivalent to the `=` character, but there are some exceptions, which we will address when they come up. This documentation follows the R convention of using `<-` in most cases.

### Help documentation

The lower right pane contains the file browser, plot viewer, and help documentation, which we will be using frequently.

## R notebooks

**Create a new R notebook using the menu bar at the top: File \> New File \> R Notebook.**

A fourth pane will open up containing a template R notebook. It should look something like this:

![An R Notebook](rstudio-7.png)

R notebooks are a special type of *markdown* document. They combine executable code, its output, and text. Markdown syntax is used to encode formatting like headings, bold or italic fonts, bullet points, links, and more. Using an R notebook keeps code, figures, and written commentary together, making it easy to generate a report with a single click.

Within a notebook, code is organized into chunks, which separates the text R will evaluate from any notes or images included in the notebook.

New chunks are added by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* on Windows, or *Cmd+Option+I* on Mac.

Code chunks are executed by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows, or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* on Mac. You can run a single line of code by placing your cursor anywhere on the line and pressing *Ctrl+Enter* on Windows, or *Cmd+Enter* on Mac.

**Create and run a new chunk with the following code:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 + 2
b <- 3 + 3
```

What happened? Where did the output for each line of code go?

**Set up a folder for the course, and save your notebook.**

Create a folder to contain all of the files for this course. 

Directories (folders) and the files they contain should be named without spaces or special characters. Using only alphanumeric characters, dots, dashes, and underscores ensures that most programming languages will be able to understand the name of your file without any problems. *If you use special characters like dollar signs, slashes, quotation marks, spaces, or parentheses, this is not always the case.*

Save your R notebook to your new folder.
